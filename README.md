# Vite-and-Prettier-Webpage-Revamp
Working with Node and NPM

1. Install the current version of Node.js.
2. In your Phase 2, Project 1 codebase, create a Git branch for this week's work. Upload your initial and new branches to GitHub if they weren't already uploaded.
3. Use NPM, bundled with Node.js, to install Vite and Prettier into your codebase.
4. Run Prettier to fix your files and commit its changes.
5. Take a screen recording of you changing the background color of your project and Vite live-reloading it in your browser.
6. Submit the screen recording and the repository, with both your before and after branch.
